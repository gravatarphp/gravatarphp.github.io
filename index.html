				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>There are thousands of <a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> clients written in PHP. Some of them are good, actively maintained, but most of them simply useless. (See: Phil Sturgeon's <a href="https://philsturgeon.uk/php/2014/10/20/php-wars-attack-of-the-clones/">PHP Wars</a> post.) This initiative tries to collect the best ideas from all existing implementations to provide an easy to use, but a powerfull tool to integrate Gravatar into applications. Some new, never seen tools will also be introduced.</p>
