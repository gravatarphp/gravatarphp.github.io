				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>By the time of this writting there are three pages of <a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> clients written in PHP and listed on <a href="https://packagist.org">Packagist</a>. 60% of them are framework agnostic, the rest are created for a specific framework (Laravel, Nette, Kohana, Silex to name a few). Some of the packages are not maintained anymore (3 years old package), some of them does not have a repository behind (they are deleted from Github). By further inspection it turns out that some of them does not even have a README or documentation. So out of 45 packages (there are 15 packages on one page) 5 or six deserves to be mentioned at all. That's a shame. (See: Phil Sturgeon's <a href="https://philsturgeon.uk/php/2014/10/20/php-wars-attack-of-the-clones/">PHP Wars</a> post.) This initiative tries to collect the best ideas from all existing implementations to provide an easy to use, but a powerfull tool to integrate Gravatar into applications. Some new, never seen tools will also be introduced.</p>
